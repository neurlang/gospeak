# codec1

Acoustic encoder/decoder based on the codec generated by kmeans1.
The decode command now:

- Takes input JSON path (-i) or raw centroids integers as string (-r)
- Takes output WAV path (-o)
- Requires centroids.json file (-v)

The encode command is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented
with actual audio processing logic later.
